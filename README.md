# Welcome to My Shopping Cart Life

>Artifact Uprising Code Challenge

This has been my life for the past 10 days.  I have definitely learned more than I ever thought.  This is my project for Artifact Uprising's Code Challenge.  It looks like a simple project, but the DevOps part nearly killed me as I knew nothing about Docker.  There were time that I thought Google didn't really know anything about it either.  The final proof is that collaboration is necessary to succeed.

Enjoy...

```
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

Stopping:

Product List is a button to display the items.  The Cart button will display items in the shopping cart.
